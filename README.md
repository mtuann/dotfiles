## üì• Copy Your Dotfiles Here

To back up your current configuration files to this folder, run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/work/dotfiles
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.vimrc ~/.zshrc ~/.tmux.conf ~/Desktop/work/dotfiles/
```

This will copy your existing dotfiles into the `dotfiles` folder for version control or sharing.

## How to Use

1. Copy these files to your home directory (or symlink them for version control).
2. Reload your shell or source the relevant file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`).
3. Open a new terminal or Vim/tmux session to see the changes.

Feel free to further customize these files to match your workflow!
